## Overview

Adrena Squads lets traders form 2–5 person teams, compete in weekly rounds, and earn USDC prizes + on-chain badges. It is built as a fully on-chain Anchor program with a Node.js scoring engine, a crank service, and a Next.js frontend.

## Architecture

### Anchor Program (17 instructions)

| Category | Instructions |
|---|---|
| Config | `initialize_config` |
| User profiles | `init_user_profile` |
| Squad management | `create_squad`, `join_squad`, `leave_squad`, `kick_member` |
| Competition lifecycle | `create_competition`, `start_competition`, `register_squad_entry`, `finalize_round`, `end_competition` |
| Prize claims | `claim_prize` (Merkle proof) |
| Prediction market | `create_prediction_pool`, `place_prediction`, `lock_predictions`, `resolve_prediction`, `claim_prediction` |

### Scoring Formula

```
member_score  = (sum_realized_pnl / max_collateral_in_single_trade) × 10 000
squad_score   = sum(member_scores, inactive = 0) / total_members
```

All scores are in **basis points** (signed `i64` on-chain). Inactive members (zero trades) drag the squad average down — teams are incentivized to keep all members active.

### Prize Distribution (Merkle)

1. Crank fetches all closed positions via Adrena's data API + `getSignaturesForAddress`
2. Computes member/squad scores, ranks, prize amounts
3. Calls `finalize_round` once per squad → competition transitions to `Calculating`
4. Builds a SHA-256 Merkle tree of `(wallet, amount)` leaves
5. Calls `end_competition(merkle_root)` → competition is `Finalized`
6. Each winner submits their proof via `claim_prize` — no trusted distributor needed

### Prediction Market

Users stake USDC on which squad they think will win. Pool is locked when the competition starts. Winners share the pot proportionally (5% fee to house), claimed via `claim_prediction`.

## PDA Seeds

| Account | Seeds |
|---|---|
| Config | `["config"]` |
| Squad | `["squad", squad_id as le64]` |
| UserProfile | `["user_profile", user_pubkey]` |
| Competition | `["competition", competition_id as le64]` |
| SquadEntry | `["squad_entry", competition_pubkey, squad_pubkey]` |
| PredictionPool | `["prediction", competition_pubkey, round_num as le32]` |
| PredictionEntry | `["pred_entry", pool_pubkey, user_pubkey]` |
| PrizeAuthority | `["prize_auth", competition_pubkey]` |
| ClaimRecord | `["claim", competition_pubkey, claimant_pubkey]` |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (Solana SBF toolchain)
- Anchor CLI 0.32.0 (`avm use 0.32.0`)
- Node.js ≥ 18, Yarn
- Solana CLI 3.x (`solana config set --url devnet`)

### Build & test the program

```bash
cd adrena-squads

# Build
anchor build

# Run integration tests (spins up local validator)
anchor test
```

### Run backend unit tests

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test
# → 22 tests, all passing
```

### Run Anchor integration tests

```bash
cd adrena-squads
anchor test
# → 19 tests, all passing
# Covers: config → profiles → competition lifecycle →
#         prediction market (place/lock/resolve/claim) →
#         prize claims with Merkle proofs + ClaimRecord double-spend guard
```

### Deploy to devnet

```bash
# 1. Build the program
anchor build

# 2. Deploy
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# 3. Initialize (one-time)
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
npx ts-node scripts/initialize.ts

# 4. Create a test competition (7-day round)
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
npx ts-node scripts/create-test-competition.ts \
  --prize-vault <vault-owned-by-prize-auth-pda>

# 5. After the round, simulate scoring + finalize
ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json \
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
npx ts-node scripts/simulate-round.ts \
  --competition <competition-pda>
```

### Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:3002
```

## API Endpoints (Backend)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/squads` | All squads |
| GET | `/api/squads/:id` | Squad + member details |
| GET | `/api/competition` | Current competition |
| GET | `/api/competition/leaderboard` | Ranked squad scores |
| GET | `/api/predictions/:round` | Prediction pool for a round |
| GET | `/api/profile/:wallet` | User profile + badges |
| POST | `/api/scores/calculate` | Trigger score recalculation (crank) |

## Scoring Unit Tests

```
calculateMemberScore
  ✓ returns zero score for empty trade list
  ✓ computes score = (realizedPnl / maxCollateral) × 10000
  ✓ uses max single-trade collateral as the denominator
  ✓ handles negative PnL (loss)
  ✓ handles mixed wins and losses
  ✓ returns 0 score when maxCollateral is 0
  ✓ rounds the score to the nearest integer
calculateSquadScore
  ✓ returns zero for empty member list
  ✓ averages member scores across all members
  ✓ inactive members (0 trades) count as 0 and drag the average down
  ✓ squad with all-inactive members scores 0
  ✓ single active member propagates score divided by total members
  ✓ preserves squadId, squadPubkey, and memberScores
rankSquads
  ✓ ranks squads in descending score order
  ✓ assigns 1-based ranks
  ✓ does not mutate the original array order
  ✓ handles a single squad / empty array / ties
rankToChampionshipPoints
  ✓ top-5 / ranks 6–10 / rank 11+

22 passing
```

## Badges

| Badge | Unlock Condition |
|---|---|
| Squad Champion | Finish #1 in a competition |
| Hot Streak | Win 3 consecutive rounds |
| Diamond Hands | Longest single-position hold |
| Perfect Round | All 5 members active in a round |
| Squad Builder | Create a squad with 5 members |
| Oracle | Predict the winner 3 rounds in a row |

Badge state is stored as a `u64` bitmask on `UserProfile`, with Metaplex Bubblegum compressed NFT minting via the crank.

## Security Notes

- Bond vault and prize vault use PDA-signed CPIs — no user funds held by EOA
- Merkle proof verification uses SHA-256 (matching `solana_program::hash::hashv`)
- Prediction pool is locked before competition goes Active — no retroactive staking
- `claim_prize` is double-spend safe via a `ClaimRecord` PDA (`["claim", competition, claimant]`) — Anchor's `init` constraint guarantees one-time initialization; any second claim attempt is rejected before execution
- `claim_prediction` uses a `claimed` boolean on `PredictionEntry` — duplicate claims are rejected with `AlreadyClaimed`
- Prediction self-stake prevention: `user_profile.current_squad != Some(squad_pubkey)` enforced on-chain

## Testing

Full test results, simulated competition walkthrough, and user feedback are documented in [`TESTING_REPORT.md`](./TESTING_REPORT.md).

**Test summary:**
- Backend scoring unit tests: **22 / 22 passing**
- Anchor integration tests: **19 / 19 passing** (full lifecycle + prediction market + security paths)
